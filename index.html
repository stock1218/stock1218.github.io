                <p>
                    I'm in my undergradute degree at Royal Holloway in computer science and information security, and I'm looking for roles in information security. I'm deeply passionate about defending against and understanding threat actors. I have technical experience building enterprise security solutions, and an international background that allows me to better understand the cyber threat landscape.
                    Areas of interest include security engineering, machine learning, malware detection and analysis, offensive security, cyberwarfare, and international politics. </p>
